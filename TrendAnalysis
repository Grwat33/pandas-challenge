Trends of Heroes of Pymoli by Garrett Watkins

1. The most popular item and the most profitable item was "Final Critic", item ID 92. It was $4.61 to purchase, and was bought 13 times for
   a total purchase value of $59.99. "Final Critic" must have provided an impressive in-game advantage, or was an appealing item to look at,
   as it was above average for cost per item.

2. The two largest age groups were 15-19 and 20-24, which could be expected, as based on item names, the game appears to have a graphic, 
   violent aspect, and those over the age of 25 don't play too many videogames. The game seems complicated and detailed, so it probably
   would not appeal to younger kids anyway. The over all sample appears to follow a trend that could be expected in a population. 15-19 
   year olds and 20-24 year olds make up over 60% of the sample size.
   
3. Average price per purchase did not differ much among age groups. The range of the average purchase price of age groups was .$45, which
   isn't much considering the range of item cost is $3.99. Despite age, each person purchased relatively close in price items.
